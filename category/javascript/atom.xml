    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sproutcore.com" title="SproutCore - Javascript Framework">SproutCore</a> is a javascript framework which tries to enable developers to build web apps that look and act more like a desktop apps.</p>

<p>It steps away from a classic web app model by moving a lot of app into the browser itself, which then interacts with server via AJAX. As it says on the <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/about/" title="About SproutCore">SproutCore site</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>After lots of testing, we have found that the most efficient way to server a SproutCore application is as a â€¦. static web page!</p></blockquote>

<p>This means that a &#8220;simple&#8221; static HTML page (which is easily served by Apache) makes browser do most of the work (i.e. server doesn&#8217;t have to generate the pages) which frees up server to respond only to AJAX initiated requests.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sproutcore.com" title="SproutCore - Javascript Framework written in Ruby">SproutCore</a> is written in Ruby, but once you build the app it will generate a set of HTML, JS and CSS files, so you don&#8217;t need to know Ruby in order to use it. As the site says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The code you write with SproutCore will resemble a desktop app written in Cocoa more than it will a web application written in Rails.</p></blockquote>

Another great thing about SproutCore is that it can be hooked up with any backend as long as it can communicate with it using HTTP. It can be anything: Rails, PHP, Perl, Java, ASP&#8230;</p>

<p>Actions speak louder than words, so take a look at the SproutCore demos which shows you exactly what it&#8217;s all about.</p>

</ul>


<p>In next few days I will try to build a sample application powered by SproutCore and Rails to see how it goes. I will post my impressions here. After all if it&#8217;s something Apple used for Mobile.me &#8211; well, it can&#8217;t be that bad. <img src='http://icebergist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>
