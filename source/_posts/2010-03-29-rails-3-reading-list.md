I&#8217;ve been planning to catchup with all the new Rails 3 stuff. To get me started I&#8217;ve compiled a small Rails 3 related reading list.

1.  [Ruby on Rails 3.0 Release Notes][1]
2.  [Active Record Query Interface 3.0][2]
3.  [The Skinny on Scopes (Formerly named_scope)][3]
4.  [Rails 3 Beautiful Code][4]
5.  [Railscasts &#8211; rails-3.0 episodes][5]
6.  [jQuery with Rails 3][6]
7.  [The Rails Module (in Rails 3)][7]

Once I&#8217;m done with it I plan to get even more from:

*   [Rails 3 Resources][8]
*   [Rails 3.0 Beta: 36 Links and Resources To Get You Going][9]
