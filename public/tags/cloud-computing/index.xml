      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;external&#34; href=&#34;http://www.mosso.com/&#34;&gt;Mosso&amp;#8217;s hosting cloud&lt;/a&gt;
at $100 / month seems like a good solution to get a scalable server. However one thing bugs me, actually two things&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First one: they offer &lt;strong&gt;FTP only access&lt;/strong&gt;. Meaning you cannot deploy sites directly from code repositories (i.e. git or svn). That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second thing that bugs me: for $100 you get quite a lot of computing power which can be used to run multiple sites &amp;#8211; but &lt;strong&gt;you are only allowed to have one Rails app running&lt;/strong&gt;. Only one. If you want additional Rails apps (for example to have a test server) you need to pay an extra fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s cloud computing and that you have to be able to run it with any additional configuration (that&amp;#8217;s why I think it&amp;#8217;s ok that you have to freeze your gems in Rails apps, because you cannot install any gems yourself)&amp;#8230; but not being able to checkout my code from repository and having to upload the whole app each time you make changes &lt;strong&gt;is really annoying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their defense, the support guy said that they are working on it, but he could give me an ETA when they&amp;#8217;ll allow something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
