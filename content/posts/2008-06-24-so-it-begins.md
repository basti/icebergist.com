Welcome to an icebergist blog. The Icebergist will be a blog about both technical and business stuff I deal with daily. From Ruby on Rails programming to time organizing, everything that’s important in my daily work as a freelance developer.

As you can see I just setup the Icebergist blog, so at the moment it&#8217;s content-free. While I write some posts you can checkout [my posts from my previous blog AS Workshop][1].

Also I maintain a tumble log called "[this should be interesting][2]" where I post small bits of information which I find useful or interesting.

If that&#8217;s not enough for you then check out my [Twitter feed][3] where I ramble daily (unless I am to lazy or too busy to do so).
